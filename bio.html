Hello, I'm Andres, an experienced software developer and illustrator from California. 
<span class="mobile-only"><br><br></span> 
I've made desktop software, mobile applications, video games, and of course, web applications.
<br><br>I work with a large variety of languages and tools, and in all sorts of environments. 
More often than not, my projects are developed using Vue.js and Express. 
I've worked with game engines Construct 2, Game Maker: Studio, Godot, and Unity. 
My illustrators of choice are GIMP and Inkscape. 
A lot of my work can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://gamejolt.com/@AndrewRivers">GameJolt</a>.
<br><br>I am also a pianist and chiptune producer, check out my music on my <a target="_blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/andr3wriv3rs">SoundCloud</a> account.
